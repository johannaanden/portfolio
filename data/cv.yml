- name: "Sappa"
  period: "2012 June - Current"
  place: "Gothenburg"
  description: "I started my career at Sappa in June 2012. I had been traveling for 4 months and when I got home I didn’t wanted to go back to the retail industry, I wanted to do something new. The retail industry wasn’t for me, it was not where I wanted to develop my career. However, I didn’t know what I wanted to do or work with, so I sent my resume to the consulting company Proffice, now Randstad. After some interviews with Proffice, I was matched with a employment at the TV provider Sappa who searched Employees for their customer service department. I liked the service part from the retail industry, but not the part of working in a store, so in a customer service, I had the opportunity to work with service but avoid the retail environment."
  description2: "I worked in the customer service for 4 years before I was promoted to team leader for the entire customer service. As team leader I had the operational responsibility for the entire customer service, but also some personal responsibility in the form of development talks with the staff. I also became a coach and coached all employees in professional sales and treatment. This was done on a regular basis with each employee once a month. After over 2 years as a team leader I had worked with customer service for over 6 years, and I realized that it was not in the direction I wanted my career to take. Instead I wanted a career in it industry, so from February 2019, I will work as a developer at Sappa's IT department."

- name: "Craft Academy"
  period: "2018 October - 2019 February"
  place: "Gothenburg"
  description: "My journey to the Craft Academy was over a year long. In September 2017, Sappa was looking for a developer, without any prior knowledge, I announced that I was interested in the employment but clarified that I had no knowledge in the area. Even though I participated in the process until the end, I understood that I would not get the employment, so when I got the information that they had chosen another person I had already decided that I would start study. The problem was, however, that I was not really interested in putting 3 years in the school bench. Together with Sappa's IT Manager we discussed the possibilities of study courses for one year and then work as a developer at Sappa. 1 year was better than 3, but I wanted to do it faster."
  description2: "In the spring of 2018 I was in Stockholm over a weekend together with Tjejer Kodar and taught me the basics of HTML and CSS. I was then introduced to their boot camp Tecnigo. So when I started reviewing the possibilities of shortening my studies even more, I began to wonder if Tecnigo was a solution. The problem was only that they only exist in Stockholm. When I began to search for this, I came across the Craft Academy. When I didn’t got accepted at the college courses I had applied for, I needed a back up plan and then Craft Academy became the obvious choice. In the end got accepted at the college courses I had applied to, but that doesn’t matter, because I’m think Craft Academy is a much better option for me."
