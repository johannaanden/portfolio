  description: "My journey to the Craft Academy was over a year long. In September 2017, Sappa was looking for a developer, without any prior knowledge, I announced that I was interested in the employment but clarified that I had no knowledge in the area. Even though I participated in the process until the end, I understood that I would not get the employment, so when I got the information that they had chosen another person I had already decided that I would start study. The problem was, however, that I was not really interested in putting 3 years in the school bench. Together with Sappa's IT Manager we discussed the possibilities of study courses for one year and then work as a developer at Sappa. 1 year was better than 3, but I wanted to do it faster. In the spring of 2018 I was in Stockholm over a weekend together with Tjejer Kodar and taught me the basics of HTML and CSS. I was then introduced to their boot camp Tecnigo. So when I started reviewing the possibilities of shortening my studies even more, I began to wonder if Tecnigo was a solution. The problem was only that they only exist in Stockholm. When I began to search for this, I came across the Craft Academy. When I didn’t got accepted at the college courses I had applied for, I needed a back up plan and then Craft Academy became the obvious choice. In the end got accepted at the college courses I had applied to, but that doesn’t matter, because I’m think Craft Academy is a much better option for me."
