  description: "I started my career at Sappa in June 2012. I had been traveling for 4 months and when I got home I didn’t wanted to go back to the retail industry, I wanted to do something new. The retail industry wasn’t for me, it was not where I wanted to develop my career. However, I didn’t know what I wanted to do or work with, so I sent my resume to the consulting company Proffice, now Randstad. After some interviews with Proffice, I was matched with a employment at the TV provider Sappa who searched Employees for their customer service department. I liked the service part from the retail industry, but not the part of working in a store, so in a customer service, I had the opportunity to work with service but avoid the retail environment. I worked in the customer service for 4 years before I was promoted to team leader for the entire customer service. As team leader I had the operational responsibility for the entire customer service, but also some personal responsibility in the form of development talks with the staff. I also became a coach and coached all employees in professional sales and treatment. This was done on a regular basis with each employee once a month. After over 2 years as a team leader I had worked with customer service for over 6 years, and I realized that it was not in the direction I wanted my career to take. Instead I wanted a career in it industry, so from February 2019, I will work as a developer at Sappa's IT department."

  description: "Even the third year in high school we had a internship, this time it was 10 weeks. I wanted to develop my sales skills and have more customer contact so I chose to have my internship at Stuk Manufaktur. Here, the sales were more personal and you had to help customers in a different way than I previously done on Gina Tricot. During my internship, I was employed and worked for evenings, weekends and on holidays. After graduating in June 2011, I started working full-time until December 2011."
